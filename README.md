# Jira Tracker
This utility provides system tray access to track time spent on Jira stories and subtasks by running a timer background process. On starting a new task, the application asks for an estimate with an optional text field for predictions. Upon finishing the task, the elapsed duration is persisted so that subsequent analysis reveals performance tendencies and the real estimate scaling factor.
